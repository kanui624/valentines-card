All creative decisions made, content created, and code written was done by me, Marley Kanui. I created this project specifically to one, start a business venture, and two, demonstrate my creative abilities and technical competency to potential clients or employers.

The skills that were necessary to complete this were:

- Knowledge of various frontend and backend technologies (see package.json) and ability to get them all to work nicley with each other.
- Experience with responsive design.
- Ability to write clean and concise javascript, html, and css code.
- Knowledge of working with 3D objects in the browser.
- Ability to create 3D objects in a third party software (blender was used for this)
- Ability to work efficiently in all of Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Media Encoder, Premiere, and After Effects were all used to the create content seen in this site)
- Experience in creating and recording music/foley and working with a Digital Audio Workstation. All audio samples in transitions are original and created from scratch (Ableton was used for this)
- Experience in working with a professional grade digital camera (all photos shown, are original)
- Experience with using git and Github
- General knowledge of working with a computer and using terminal.
- Ability to conceptualize original creative ideas and think of alternate solutions when they don't work (the initial ones never do)
- Extensive problem solving skills (there were a lot to solve)
- Extensive researching and googling skills (most of my time was spent doing this)
- General Ability to stay focused, see a clear vision for what I want, and persevere through the adversity of not seeing the product of my work immediately.

However, if you are a recruiter or employer you can view my currently written code to get a feel for what I can do or you can contact me and I can provision you a link to view this site in it's developing state. Thank you.
